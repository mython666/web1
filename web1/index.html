<p>The East China Sea is a marginal sea surrounded by the Chinese mainland and Taiwan Island, as well as the Korean Peninsula and Japan's Kyushu and Ryukyu Islands. It is connected to the Sea of Japan in the northeast through the Tsushima Strait, and to the South China Sea in the southwest through the Taiwan Strait. <a href="https://baike.baidu.com/item/%e4%b8%9c%e6%b5%b7/18322"
